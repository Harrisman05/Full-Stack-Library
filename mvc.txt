For every route set-up, if information is sent back to the client using res.render(), then an equivalent view file is created to render these views (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esy4nRuShl8&list=RDLVqj2oDkvc4dQ&start_radio=1&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified) - for example, get all authors and get new authors routes in authors.js file both have ejs file for rendering information. Then these routers need to be imported into server.js file and mounted onto the correct resource (in this case, /authors). /authors is prepended to become the root of the route so the router works properly
